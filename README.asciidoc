# Stock APIs


###### Motivation

This project is an assignment. Implemented code would be a nice example of Stock data APIs.


### Features

Stock APIs provides

- Create, update and fetch stock data using HTTP endpoints.

- Used AKKA to achieve fine grained control of the consistency level for reads and writes.

- Scalable and highly available NoSQL data store.

- Made a sample UI, go to the `frontend-angular-app` directory and follow the readme.

### How to run


###### Prerequisite
- JDK 1.8 (Tested with Oracle JDK)
- Maven 3.6.x+
- Docker (18.09.2), Docker Compose (1.23.2)

###### Run Cassandra in Docker
```
$ docker-compose up
```

###### Build
```
$ mvn clean compile install
```

###### Run
```
$ java -jar target/stock-api-1.0.0.jar
```
or
```
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

###### Quick test

Create Stock
```
curl -X POST localhost:8080/api/stocks \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{ "name": "Apple", "currentPrice": 10.0 }'
```
example response
```
{"id":"b9ee0544-1a4d-4ae5-b22e-3a05e4c4c6f1"}
```

Get first page of Stocks
```
curl -X GET localhost:8080/api/stocks \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
example response
```
{
   "data":[
      {
         "id":"b9ee0544-1a4d-4ae5-b22e-3a05e4c4c6f1",
         "name":"Apple",
         "currentPrice":10.0,
         "lastUpdate":1563738072242
      }
   ],
   "pageNo":0,
   "pageSize":10
}
```

Get second page of Stocks
```
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/api/stocks?pageNo=1&pageSize=10' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
example response
```
{
   "data":[

   ],
   "pageNo":1,
   "pageSize":10
}

```

Get stock by id
```
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/api/stocks/b9ee0544-1a4d-4ae5-b22e-3a05e4c4c6f1' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
example response
```
{
   "id":"b9ee0544-1a4d-4ae5-b22e-3a05e4c4c6f1",
   "name":"Apple",
   "currentPrice":10.0,
   "lastUpdate":1563738072242
}

```

Update Stock by id
```
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:8080/api/stocks/b9ee0544-1a4d-4ae5-b22e-3a05e4c4c6f1' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{ "name": "Apple Inc", "currentPrice": 20.0 }'
```
example response
```
{
   "id":"b9ee0544-1a4d-4ae5-b22e-3a05e4c4c6f1",
   "name":"Apple Inc",
   "currentPrice":20.0,
   "lastUpdate":1563741056100
}

```


### Design Decisions

- According to assignment, Stock Id should be number.
  * Choose String instead of long / int. Type 4 UUID create hard to predict id, better than predictable number id.
  * Usually better that number but has it's own flaw. Just a choice.

- According to assignment, the list of stocks should be created in memory on application startup.
  * Did not do it because in-memory cache could cause cache consistency problem during scaling.
  * Added dummy data on dev profile to demo purpose.

- Authentication and authorization is not taking into consideration.

- AKKA creates mailbox (queue) that perform action on data. Provides fine grained control over reads and writes of current price of stocks.

- NoSQL data store is an obvious choice. Cassandra provides high scalability and availability.

- Choose Reactive REST endpoint with Spring WebFlux because AKKA is already reactive and it consumes less resource.


### Development
##### How to run tests

###### How to run unit tests
To run the unit tests, execute the following commands
```
mvn clean test-compile test
```

###### How to run integration tests
To run the integration tests, execute the following commands
```
mvn clean test-compile verify -DskipTests=true
```

###### How to run both unit tests and integration tests
To run the integration tests, execute the following commands
```
mvn clean test-compile verify
```

###### How to run pitest
To run the mutation tests, execute the following commands
```
mvn clean test-compile test
mvn org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage
```


### Improvements to make
- Improve architectural design, completed the project in 12 hours.
- Code improvements
  * Type casting in REST controller and in StockActor is not nice, need to fix it. First time working with AKKA and WebFlux.
  * Use Cassandra with reactive spring repository.
- Build docker image (plugin already added in the pom).
- Generate and check OWASP report.
- Improve code coverage, e.g. adding end-to-end tests.
